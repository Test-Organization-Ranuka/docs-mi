## Environment compatibility

- Install a JDK version that is [compatible with this product version]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/reference/product-compatibility/).
- It is not recommended to use Apache DS in a production environment due to scalability issues. Instead, use an LDAP like OpenLDAP as your user store.
- If you have difficulty in setting up the Micro Integrator in a specific platform or database, [contact us](https://wso2.com/contact/).
